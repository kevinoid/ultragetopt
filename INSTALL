To install ultragetopt as a shared library, run

	./configure
	make
	make install

where the final command is run with the necessary privileges (depending on the
prefix argument given to configure or to access /usr/local if none specified).

To include ultragetopt as part of a software package, simply copy
ultragetopt.{c,h} into the appropriate directory and include it in the build
scripts for the software package.  To use ultragetopt*() functions as
replacements for getopt(), define ULTRAGETOPT_REPLACE_GETOPT before including
"ultragetopt.h".  (Note:  If you really need the opt* variables to not be
macros, simply run sed 's/ultra//g' on the ultragetopt source files and do not
define ULTRAGETOPT_REPLACE_GETOPT when including ultragetopt.h)

Note also, for including ultragetopt.c as part of a software package, if
targeted systems may not provide strcasecmp or strncasecmp you must provide a
replacement for these functions.  For systems (such as Windows) that provide
_stricmp and _strnicmp, define HAVE__STRICMP and HAVE__STRNICMP and those
functions will perform the needed function (for autoconf, this can be
accomplished with AC_CHECK_FUNCS([strcasecmp strnicasecmp _stricmp _strnicmp]).
