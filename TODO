This file contains a list of things that need work (or are being considered).
Anyone can feel free to add thoughts for future features or plans for the
software as they wish.  This file is just for brainstorming and documenting
ideas that have been proposed.

* Create a thorough test script/framework and run on all variants of getopt
  that you can find and report on incompatibilities
* Create man page?  Are there systems using man pages that don't have getopt()
  documentation already?  Would a separate ultragetopt man page be useful?
* Compiled help file?  Do Windows developers use these things?
* Implement some/all of the features of egetopt()?
