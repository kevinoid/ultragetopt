* GNU getopt() handles option permutation somewhat differently.  It shifts
  options around on calls subsequent to actually returning the next option (so
  cmd word -a) would return -a then on the next call shift the command line to
  read cmd -a word and return -1.  It therefore also has different values for
  optind than ultragetopt in these cases.  If there is a use case that requires
  this behavior, please let the maintainer know about it so that a change to
  ultragetopt to mimic this behavior can be considered.
